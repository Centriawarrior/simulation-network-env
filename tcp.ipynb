    "Transport layer protocols TCP (Transport Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) solves the first problem by port-numbers. Destination port number and source port number identifies the communication applications.\n",

    "TCP also solves the second problem - reliability -  by error detection, sequence numbers,  automatic retransmission and acknowledgement mechanism. UDP instead is a lightweight transport protocol that solves only the application addressing problem.  It could be e.g. the choice for applications when communication between client and server is just one short request and one short response. \n",

    "## TCP Session\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "To make its features possible TCP uses sessions. Session concept means that the communication can be in different states. E.g. to establish communication the client needs to ask the server to accept session creation with some parameter values. Server can accept it and suggest its own session related parameters. If a client accepts them then the session is established. Flag-field bits SYN and ACK are related to session setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The session concept makes it possible for parties to be aware of the amount and order of bytes received and transferred during the session - this information is visible in TCP header's sequence number and acknowledgement number fields. The acknowledgement of received data happens by telling in the acknowledgement number field what byte number the receiver is expecting next. If the sender doesn't get acknowledgement within a certain time it resends data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP implements flow control by window mechanism. Both parties tell in the TCP header what is the maximum number of bytes  (window) the other party can send without getting an acknowledgement. \n",
    "\n",
    "##   Packet Tracer Simulation\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "We use PT simulation in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User connects with the browser to a www-server. In this scenario we see that the browser and www-server use the TCP-transport layer in their communication. We also see what port numbers they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User pings the target computer using its domain name. In this scenario we see that DNS-queries and answers are sent using UDP-transport layer protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Server applications use so-called well-known port numbers that make it possible for client application developers to use those port numbers as default destination port numbers so that application users don't need to tell the server application port number in the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first scenario it is also possible to see TCP-session setup between client and server if you look at the FLAGS-field. That is however difficult because the individual FLAGS-field bits are not named in the simulator trace. The figure below helps you understand the role that SYN-bit and ACK-bit plays in a session setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ ](images/flags.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Firewalls use this information to protect home network in the following way: if an IP-packet coming from Internet carries TCP and the TCP has SYN-bit set (without ACK-bit) it rejects this packet because it means that someone is trying to setup a session with a device in your home network. This kind of protection is typically the default configured behaviour for home firewalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced: In the first PT-scenario you can see also the initial window-sizes that client and server suggest for the session. The ACKs in session setup means also that the ACK-sender accepts the other party's suggested windows-size for the session. In our PT simulation Client TCP suggested 65535 bytes window-size and Server TCP suggested 16384 bytes window-size. What does this mean in practice?"
