    "IP-packets are very much like envelopes with contents in the postal network. The envelope cover must contain a destination address that has a certain format. The sender address is optional. You must put a stamp on the envelope too.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The envelope content e.g., letter is free form and postal network people, and sorting machines do not take a look at it – that is not needed in the envelope routing from sender to destination.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "An IP-packet has a header and a varying length of content that is called payload. The header must always have a destination's IP-address and sender's IP-address in certain points of the header. Because the IP-packet is handled by computers, routing devices are also computers, everything in the header must be accurately standardized. For the same reason there must be some additional information in the header compared to envelopes that are used in the postal network. No stamp like thing is needed because if there is a payment, it is subscription based like e.g., in your ISP-operator connection.\n",

    "You saw in the traceroute exercise that data packets, called IP packets, \"flow\" from source computer to the destination computer through many intermediate nodes which are called routers. The intermediate routers are owned by network operator companies. The IP packets may travel through many individual network operators’ networks. Some of the operators have very large networks that may span many countries, even continents. Some operators are small, and their networks may cover only a limited area eq. one city. A special case is a situation where both the sender and receiver are in the same network e.g. in a company LAN. In that case there are no routers between the sender and receiver. \n",

    "## IP -protocol specification\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "I recommed you to take a teacher-led guided review to the RFC-791 document that specifies the IP-protocol. The document explains IP-protocol's two main tasks. The first is: to provide a mechanism to transmit independent blocks of data (IP-packets) from source to destination. Both source and destination are identified by fixed length addresses (IP-addresses). The document also describes how the IP-protocol module plays together with other communication software modules inside computers and routers.\n",
    "\n",

    "To fulfil its task the IP-layer on one computer must cooperate with its peer on another computer. The control information in the packet header makes this possible. Below you see the IP-header content.\n",

    "\n",
    "The IP-packet is just a series of consecutive bytes where the first bytes constitute the header and after that comes the payload bytes that are user data or other protocols messages.  The way to express the header structure in documentation as four bytes per row like in Figure 1 is just a convention.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "For us, the essential header fields are version, time to live, protocol, source address and destination address and of course the actual payload data that is not visible in the picture. Their need is easy to understand after some discussion. We discuss them on the lecture, or you can try to find those reasons yourself."

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, computers reside in Local Area Networks (LAN) like Ethernet or Wi-Fi LANs. LAN standards specify concrete ways to transmit and receive data in local networks. IP Protocol itself is a message format specification and rules for its routing and logical handling - it does not specify the concrete way to transmit the message physically. \n",

    "## How IP packets are transmitted and received in a LAN\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "The messages that computers send and receive in an Ethernet (802.3) Local Area Network are called Ethernet frames. This means that every IP-packet must be carried inside an Ethernet frame in a LAN.  In Figure 2 you see the Ethernet frame's structure. Ethernet addressing is based on six bytes long MAC-addresses. Each computer in an Ethernet LAN has a unique MAC-address that is set into the Ethernet adapter in the factory. Besides unique MAC-addresses Ethernet (802.3) standard defines a broadcast address with all bits one. When a computer sends a frame using broadcast destination address then all computers must read that frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/ethernet-frame.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And figure show the ethernet frame\n",
    "\n",
    "When Ethernet carries an IP-packet the packet resides in the payload and the two bytes long type field code has a value 0x0800. The receiving computer's Ethernet driver knows from this code that it should give the payload's contents to the IP-layer.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3 presents a small Ethernet LAN with visible MAC-addresses. The LAN is configured to be an IP-network 192.168.1.0/24. When users want to connect e.g. to a webserver they specify the destination by its IP-address. Users do not tell the destination's MAC-address. This means that the sending computer must somehow resolve the MAC-address of the destination computer whose IP-address the user has given. In Figure 3 a user has written a destination IP-address 192.168.1.254 into the browser destination address field. To send IP-packets to that address PC0 must first find out what is the MAC-address of the computer whose IP-address is 192.168.1.254. It must do this in order to put the correct destination MAC-address to the frames that will carry the IP-packets to the correct computer.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use the Packet tracer simulation function to see how PC0 finds the MAC-address of the computer whose IP-address is 192.168.1.254.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resolving functionality resides between IP-layer and Ethernet layer in the computers, and it has its own messages and rules that is called ARP-protocol. Basically it works in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- First the ARP-\"layer\" get from the IP-layer a task to send an IP-packet to a certain destination IP\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ARP-layer must first resolve the MAC-address of the computer whose IP-address is the given IP. To do that the ARP-\"layer\" asks Ethernet-layer to send a frame using broadcast address and a payload whose meaning is: If your IP-address is this IP, tell me what your MAC-address is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every computer's Ethernet-layer reads the frame because the destination address is broadcast address. The type-field in the frame (set by sender) shows that the payload contains ARP-message. That is why each computer gives the frame's payload to the ARP-layer that will analyze the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The computer whose ARP-layer recognizes that the message contains this computer's IP-address, answers the question by asking its Ethernet-layer to send an answer message to the questioning computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The questioning computer's Ethernet layer receives the answer frame and due the type-field value (ARP-type) gives it to the ARP-layer that will now compete the original task by asking Ethernet layer to send the IP-packet using the MAC-address that was got in the ARP-answer.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "ARP-layer saves the answer to limited time cache memory so that it does not need to repeat the process for subsequent IP-packets to the same destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PT-simulation shows the above steps illustratively and helps you understand the address resolution process. Basically it is one question from the sending computer to all other computers in the LAN and one answer from the intended destination computer to the question sender, see Figure 4\n",
